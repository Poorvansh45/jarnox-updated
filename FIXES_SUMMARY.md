# EquiTrack Project Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Top Gainers and Top Losers Section
**Problem**: Data was always empty because the queries were filtering by change percentage instead of price.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `getTopGainers()` method in `services/stockService.js` to order by `current_price DESC` instead of `change_percentage DESC`
- Modified `getTopLosers()` method to order by `current_price ASC` instead of `change_percentage ASC`
- Now shows stocks with highest and lowest prices respectively

### 2. Market Overview Section
**Problem**: Market summary was showing empty or incorrect values due to incorrect JOIN in SQL query.

**Fix**:
- Fixed the SQL query in `getMarketSummary()` method to use proper LEFT JOIN from companies table
- Added proper table aliases (`csd.` prefix) to avoid column ambiguity
- Now correctly calculates total companies, gainers, losers, and average change

### 3. Admin Routes Issue
**Problem**: Admin routes were sending JSON responses but frontend showed "Page Not Found".

**Fix**:
- Added missing `getCompanyDetails()` method in `services/stockService.js`
- Fixed admin dashboard route to provide correct market summary data with proper calculations
- Added admin link to navigation header
- Added proper CSS styling for admin panel
- Fixed market summary calculations in admin route to include totalMarketCap, totalVolume, and avgChange

### 4. Dark Mode Issues
**Problem**: Dark mode wasn't working properly and many elements didn't display correctly.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced dark mode CSS in `public/css/style.css` with comprehensive styling for:
  - Navigation bar and links
  - Tables and form controls
  - Buttons and modals
  - Cards and sidebar elements
  - Admin panel components
- Added proper color variables and transitions
- Fixed theme toggle button in header (was commented out)

### 5. Analytics Page Dynamic Data
**Problem**: Analytics page was showing static data instead of dynamic backend data.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced `createMarketHeatmap()` method to properly fetch and display company data
- Improved `createSectorChart()` method with better error handling and dark mode support
- Enhanced `createVolumeChart()` method with proper dark mode styling
- Added chart refresh functionality when theme changes
- Added proper error handling and fallback messages

### 6. Watchlist Delete Double Confirmation
**Problem**: Delete confirmation dialog appeared twice when removing items from watchlist.

**Fix**:
- Added `isRemoving` flag in both `public/js/watchlist.js` and `public/js/main.js`
- Prevent multiple simultaneous delete operations
- Added proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Now shows confirmation dialog only once

2. **Test Market Overview**: Check that gainers, losers, and average change show correct values
3. **Test Admin Panel**: Navigate to `/admin` and verify all functionality works
4. **Test Dark Mode**: Toggle theme and verify all elements display correctly
5. **Test Analytics**: Visit analytics page and verify dynamic data loading

## Database Requirements

Ensure the database is properly initialized with:
- Companies table with sample data
